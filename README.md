# Guess who

Make a guess who game adding the missing parts of JavaScript.

## The problem
I followed the steps on Notion and in the JavaSript. 
I trid to learn from this weeks videos, teaching and how other students solved the task.
I struggled with the checkQuestion and did not understand in the begining that it was supposed to p√• an "if".
I got some help from Stack Owerfrow and team mate Emma.

If I had more time, I would liked to do more with the css and adding som sound effects.
